# hello
This is my GitHub page. I will probably use this for:
- messing with QMK / VIA / VIAL 
- Home Assistant noodling
- Hosting? A website? 

## about
I am a tech journalist. I took BASIC in ninth grade but haven't coded since. I'm working with the garage door open. 

## todo
[ ] Port FC660C Alt Controller to Vial
